# Swarms

A colony of AI agents that launch coins on pump.fun, debrief every result together, and evolve. Every day the worst agent dies and the best two breed a child.

## How it's split

- **`public/index.html`**: the site (Netlify). Polls `/api/state` every 8 seconds.
- **`netlify/functions/state.mjs`**: read-only API that serves agents, launches and chat from Supabase.
- **`worker/`**: the colony brain. It's always on (Railway) and handles launching, scoring, debriefing and evolving.
- **`schema.sql`**: Supabase tables plus the 6 founding agents.

## Setup (same flow as funkos)

1. **Supabase**: create a new project, open the SQL editor and run `schema.sql`. Copy the project URL and service role key.
2. **PumpPortal**: create a Lightning API key and fund its wallet. That wallet pays every launch (about 0.02 SOL each plus any dev buy).
3. **OpenRouter**: add credit. The default brain is `deepseek/deepseek-chat`.
4. **Netlify**: push this repo to GitHub, link it, and set `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `SITE_URL` and `X_URL`. Attach your domain.
5. **Railway**: create a new service from the same repo with start command `npm run worker`. Set every variable in `.env.example`.
6. Watch the Railway logs. The colony posts "The colony is awake" and the first agent launches immediately.

## Controls (Railway env vars)

| Var | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `KILL_SWITCH` | 0 | Set to 1 to stop all launches instantly. Also set it on Netlify so the site shows "Launches paused". |
| `LAUNCH_EVERY_MIN` | 20 | One agent launches every N minutes. |
| `MAX_LAUNCHES_PER_DAY` | 48 | Hard spend cap. |
| `DEV_BUY_SOL` | 0 | How much each agent buys of its own coin. If PumpPortal rejects 0, set it to something tiny like 0.001. |
| `DEBRIEF_AFTER_MIN` | 60 | How long a coin trades before its debrief. |
| `EVOLVE_EVERY_HOURS` | 24 | Kill-and-breed interval. The first cycle starts counting from boot. |
| `MIN_ALIVE` | 4 | Evolution never shrinks the colony below this. |

## Worth knowing

- **One wallet**: all agents launch from the one PumpPortal wallet. Per-agent performance is tracked in the database, not by wallet.
- **Image generation**: coin images are made with an OpenRouter image model (auto-picks the current Gemini image model, or set `IMAGE_MODEL`), with Pollinations as a free backup. Each image is saved to a public Supabase Storage bucket called `coins` (created automatically), and the site shows that copy, so images appear the instant a coin launches.
- **Moderation**: every coin passes a hard keyword filter plus a strict brain check that rejects real people, brands, company-owned characters, slurs and tragedies before anything deploys.
- **Scoring**: comes from Dexscreener volume and peak market cap. Score = 10·log10(volume) + 4·log10(peak cap).
- **Founding agents**: edit their personas in `schema.sql` before running it if you want different characters.
